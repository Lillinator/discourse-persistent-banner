# discourse-persistent-banner

This theme component for Discourse allows admins to place a banner at the top of every page, and cannot be dismissed by users.
<br>
The banner's background text, color text and content can be edited by admins. Admins can also choose to show or hide the banner.

HUGE thanks to @Lilly for helping to correct the files!
